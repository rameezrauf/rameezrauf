## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a a student at the School of Data Science at the University of Virginia. I am double majoring in Data Sciecne and Economics. As a dedicated and aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis, computer vision, and engineering, I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills to drive innovation and insights in dynamic environments. Currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Data Science and Economics at the University of Virginia, I have consistently demonstrated academic excellence, achieving a 3.84 GPA and making the Dean's List every eligible semester.

In my professional journey, I have successfully applied my skills in various impactful projects and internships. Leading the development of a Keras-based model to detect strike zones in baseball footage, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy. As a Research Assistant, I contributed to the creation of a computer vision model for movement detection in diverse environments. Integrated scholarly research to improve model precision while utilizing PyTorch on remote servers for effective model deployment.

I am an effective communicator and collaborator, eager to continue expanding my expertise in data science. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to solve complex problems, leverage data for strategic decision-making, and innovate within the fields of data science and engineering.
